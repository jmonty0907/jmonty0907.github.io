<ht>DEMO ONLY 

Your network has been penetrated.

All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorithm.

Backups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.

Shadow copies were also removed, so F8 or any other methods may damage encrypted data but not recover.

We exclusively have decryption software for your situation

No decryption software is available to the public.

DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN - files may be damaged

DO NOT RENAME OR MOVE the encrypted and readme files.

DO NOT DELETE readme files.

DO NOT use any recovery software with restoring files overwriting encrypted.

This may lead to impossibility of recovery of certain files.
