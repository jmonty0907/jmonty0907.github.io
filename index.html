<h1>Your network has been penetrated.</h1>

<h2>All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorithm.<br>
<br>
Backups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.<br>

Shadow copies were also removed, so F8 or any other methods may damage encrypted data but not recover.<br>
<br>
We exclusively have decryption software for your situation<br>
<br>
No decryption software is available to the public.<br>
<br>
DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN - files may be damaged<br>

DO NOT RENAME OR MOVE the encrypted and readme files.<br>

DO NOT DELETE readme files.<br>

DO NOT use any recovery software with restoring files overwriting encrypted.<br>
<br>
This may lead to impossibility of recovery of certain files.<br>
